SocializeMe, a social media app developed using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. This app connects users in a seamless and engaging way. It features secure authentication through FirebaseAuth, allowing users to create and manage posts while viewing content from others on a dedicated posts screen.

Users can easily search for profiles, navigate to their own profile page to manage and delete their posts, and engage in real-time chats with fellow users. The app also integrates Gmail for email communications, making it easy to connect.

For backend support, I utilized Firebase Cloud Firestore for user data storage and Firebase Storage for images. State management is handled by Bloc, and I incorporated features like the Image Picker, Shared Preferences, Modal Progress HUD, and URL Launcher for added functionality.
